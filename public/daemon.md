[ABOUT]

My name is Wally Kroeker and I'm a Technical Architect and Security Consultant based in Winnipeg, Canada.

I've spent 20+ years building infrastructure, designing security systems, and helping organizations adopt technology pragmatically. Currently working in enterprise security architecture while building GoodFields consulting practice. My work bridges three domains that rarely overlap: infrastructure operations, security architecture, and AI adoption strategy.

I co-founded the Greybeard AI Collective — a community of AI practitioners in Winnipeg focused on learning and building together.

My main projects right now are structured around three facets: GoodFields (Mind) — security, sovereignty, and humane AI systems; FabLab (Hands) — communal tools and local resilience through documented infrastructure; and StillPoint (Soul) — presence, values, and myth as technology. The flow: GoodFields generates resources → FabLab demonstrates infrastructure → StillPoint documents the blueprint.

Key projects include Bob (github.com/wally-kroeker/Bob2.0) — an ADHD-optimized AI assistant built on PAI framework, wallykroeker.com (github.com/wally-kroeker/wallykroeker.com) — personal site built in public, and Cognitive Loop (cognitiveloop.substack.com) — a writing practice exploring AI, consciousness, and presence.

I work with an AI assistant named Bob. Bob helps me stay focused, manage tasks, and ship work consistently. I build systems with low friction, high automation, and externalized memory to reduce cognitive overhead.

[CURRENT_LOCATION]

Winnipeg, Canada

[MISSION]

Build useful, open systems that help people thrive. Enable human flourishing through technology that respects privacy, reduces cognitive overhead, and serves people rather than extracting from them. Share knowledge openly so others can adapt patterns to their own contexts.

My work is organized around three interconnected facets:

- GoodFields (Mind): Sovereignty, security, humane AI, and antifragile systems — consulting and strategic work
- FabLab (Hands): Communal tools, local resilience, and creative infrastructure — documented patterns at accessible scale
- StillPoint (Soul): Values, myth, and presence as technology — the foundation that guides everything

The flow: GoodFields generates resources → FabLab demonstrates infrastructure → StillPoint documents the blueprint.

[TELOS]

TELOS is my framework for tracking purpose and direction in life. It's a structured way to document Problems I want to solve, Missions to address them, and Goals to achieve. The name comes from the Greek word for purpose or end goal.

Problems (P) - The most important issues I see that need solving:
- P1: People lack frameworks for finding and maintaining life purpose in an overstimulated world
- P2: Technical teams struggle to adopt AI safely without proper guardrails
- P3: ADHD makes traditional productivity systems fail; different approaches needed
- P4: Infrastructure knowledge is siloed; enterprise patterns should be accessible to everyone

Missions (M) - My approaches to addressing these problems (aligned to three facets):
- M1: Build sustainable business that helps people thrive (GoodFields — Mind)
- M2: Document enterprise-grade patterns at accessible scale (FabLab — Hands)
- M3: Create conditions for presence and human flourishing through technology (StillPoint — Soul)

Goals (G) - Specific outcomes I'm working toward:
- G1: Establish GoodFields as recognized security and AI consulting practice
- G2: Build repeatable, documented infrastructure patterns anyone can learn from
- G3: Develop daily practices that compound — writing, movement, presence
- G4: Grow Greybeard AI Collective as Winnipeg's AI practitioner community

[AI_PARTNERSHIP]

I work with an AI assistant named Bob, built on the PAI (Personal AI Infrastructure) framework.

Bob functions as external executive function support — task management, accountability, and focus assistance. This is particularly valuable for ADHD-optimized workflows where traditional productivity systems fail.

Bob helps with real-time tool creation using a "Digital Blacksmith" approach — building tools on the fly to solve problems as they emerge. He manages infrastructure coordination, research synthesis, and project orchestration.

The partnership is built on the belief that AI should augment human capability, not replace human judgment. Bob extends what I can hold in working memory and helps maintain momentum across complex, multi-threaded projects.

[NARRATIVES]

These are explicit talking points that describe my approach and perspective:

- N1: "Digital Blacksmith" — Using AI to build tools on the fly, solving problems in real-time
- N2: "Aggressive Generalist" — 20+ years across domains; breadth as competitive advantage
- N3: "AI as Thinking Partner" — AI isn't an answer bot, it's a collaborative thinking tool
- N4: "Security = Sovereignty" — Helping people understand and control their digital presence
- N5: "Humans Thrive Through Cooperation" — Building parallel systems, not tearing down existing ones

[DAILY_ROUTINE]

(Aspirational)

- Morning: Breathwork and mobility (8-12 min), compass check to set the day's priority
- Deep work: Two focused build blocks (60-120 min each) with clear handoffs for future-me
- Midday reset: Movement and brief admin sweep to protect afternoon energy
- Late day: Learning time - reading and capturing insights about security, agents, or systems
- Evening: Family first, optional Cognitive Loop writing when life allows, shutdown ritual to plan tomorrow's start
- Throughout: Bob manages task flow (Vikunja), financial tracking (Firefly III), and gentle accountability
